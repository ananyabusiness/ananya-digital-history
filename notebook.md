Discussing digital history is undeniably important in our current place in the digital age. I have found thorugh my own preconceptions of the concept of digital history, along with Douglas Seefeldt and William Thomans' definiton of digital history [2] that there is a new reality, or perhaps dimension, created by the digital space that is aptly reflected through Histrians' ongoing efforts to digitize history. Discussions of crossing boundaries of tradition, and addressing tension between maintaining historical integrity and expanding toward new innovations. This was my first time using Github, so navigating the space and creating new repositories was definitely a learning curve! I honestly really enjoy the layout and interface of the website and I hope to increase my comfort with the medium as we navigate through the course. I have coded before, but only in teh statistics realm, so navigating Github, I realized that I still had a lot of preconcieved notions of what using more advanced technological interfaces would be like. I was a little daunted by the idea of coding, because of my experiences with R. I feel that my nerves relate heavily to chapter one of "Technology and the Historian: Transformations in the Digital Age By: Adam Crymble. I found that I had a misconception that technology was going to be and entirely daunting, expertise-driven "seamless continuom"[3] that I would need to hunker down to learn if I wanted to keep up with the constantly evolving realm of Humanities. In truth, coming at these concepts from a post-moderm Metaphysics background, I can see immediately that there is much more to the discussion of presence, ethics, and progressions within History. I terally enjoyed Benjamin Schmidt's explanaition of Technology being constructed through grey-scale, rather than black-and-white thinking. [4] He thouroughly understood that there is much more nuance and ambiguity possible through technology than we commonly understand. Yet importantly, it remains a tool and not a replacement for human involvement, which I find to be one of the most important conversations surrounding technology within the Humanities. It closely relates to the understandings of a new dimension entering the human sphere. There are countless complexities to the presence of digital spaces, yet with great acknowledgement and reacknowledgement of humanity, it seems to hold a great potential for the future. I am excited to learn Github, create a website, and construct my first digital History project.
