Discussing digital history is undeniably important in our current place in the digital age. I have found thorugh my own preconceptions of the concept of digital history, along with Douglas Seefeldt and William Thomans' definiton of digital history [2] that there is a new reality, or perhaps dimension, created by the digital space that is aptly reflected through Histrians' ongoing efforts to digitize history. Discussions of crossing boundaries of tradition, and addressing tension between maintaining historical integrity and expanding toward new innovations. This was my first time using Github, so navigating the space and creating new repositories was definitely a learning curve! I honestly really enjoy the layout and interface of the website and I hope to increase my comfort with the medium as we navigate through the course. I have coded before, but only in teh statistics realm, so navigating Github, I realized that I still had a lot of preconcieved notions of what using more advanced technological interfaces would be like. I was a little daunted by the idea of coding, because of my experiences with R. I feel that my nerves relate heavily to chapter one of "Technology and the Historian: Transformations in the Digital Age By: Adam Crymble. I found that I had a misconception that technology was going to be and entirely daunting, expertise-driven "seamless continuom"[3] that I would need to hunker down to learn if I wanted to keep up with the constantly evolving realm of Humanities. In truth, coming at these concepts from a post-moderm Metaphysics background, I can see immediately that there is much more to the discussion of presence, ethics, and progressions within History. I terally enjoyed Benjamin Schmidt's explanaition of Technology being constructed through grey-scale, rather than black-and-white thinking. [4] He thouroughly understood that there is much more nuance and ambiguity possible through technology than we commonly understand. Yet importantly, it remains a tool and not a replacement for human involvement, which I find to be one of the most important conversations surrounding technology within the Humanities. It closely relates to the understandings of a new dimension entering the human sphere. There are countless complexities to the presence of digital spaces, yet with great acknowledgement and reacknowledgement of humanity, it seems to hold a great potential for the future. I am excited to learn Github, create a website, and construct my first digital History project.

Creating a static site with Jekyll was SO INTERESTING! I chose not to use AI to build my HTML and to go though my Terminal using Jekyll. I first had to install Xcode, Homebrew, Ruby, Node, then finally jekyll. I encounted loads of issues with installation at first. I then realized (after a cool 12 hours of Ruby freezing during installlation) that it was mostly because I had not updated my Mac OS in centuries. I believe I was 12 updates (or rather upgrades?) behind. Once I went ahead and updated my computer, I was able to finish my installations, link my Github. Then I encountered an issue running jekyll, or getting my code/computer to know where to find ruby because I updated my computer too much. Tahoe 26.2 makes to really difficult for the installed (applications?) to find (what they need to find). I then figured it out. slowly but surely, going from Ruby 4.0 to ruby 3.2.10 to ruby 3.2.2, trouble shooting, then eventually creating my jekyll folder. I went on and on with these assorted codes to make sure that everything was in order, maybe for an hour or so; then after everything and linking my github, I see that we are not allowed to use Github Pages because of the admin account. So I am really not sure what to do from here. I see that I can host my website elsewhere and still work entirely in Jekyll/my Github repository, but the website will just be hosted elsewhere. 


Downloading the first necessities for Terminal:

Trying Dr. Carty's alternatives for downloading packages from other static sites. It did not work for me becase they were too big, and although it was possible to download them individually, I decided to go back to what I was doing in terminal.

Installation of Homebrew; I had to install it, then Ruby/Ruby Gems for homebrew (Which is the coding language that Jekyll uses), then NodeJS (a development platform that helps Javascript run faster), then lastly Jekyll and it's bundler.

Then I had to go in and test everything to make sure that it was all running, or at least available to run.

I knew from class that the NCSU Github account did not allow full access for us to create a website, but i learned through this process that it specifically does nto allow us to HOST our websites through the Github account. I saw online that I can host my account thorugh a few other free online spaces, and keep working/building through github and just not host through them. I can also possibly create my own Github account to host the site through there. 

I went ahead and created my html, but have not hosted the site elsewhere yet! This was a really fun process, learning how to code and build the components of the website. I am excited to keep going with the process!

After going through the process of trying to create a website through Jekyll and Github, I really understood how genuinely difficult is was to minimally compute. Although AI exists and could be more easily be used to build a website, The non-generated methods were quite complicated, not easily accessible, and required so much patience in the end. I thought a lot about one of Risam and Gil's explained Tense Origins: 'Choice Vs. Necessity.' I initially chose to try my hand a Jekyll for that very reason. I found it could be really important to learn computing outside of Artifical Intelligence, and many places do not have that option (or are willing to indulge in that option.) I found that writing, or rather copy-pasting code into Terminal was not only difficult, but unbelievable rewarding and helped me reorient my percetion of website building and digitization  entirely. I feel now that the discussion of computing is that much more nuanced, I feel I can understand a bit more thouroughly when Risam and Gill call minimal computing a Rorschach Inkblot, It is extremely expansive and moldable. On the other hand, the drastic difference between what I was doing over the weekend and what I saw some of my peers complete in about an hour mintues during the workshop last week was intense? The capacity to create and customize a website using AI in barely any time at all compared to sitting for a few hours at a time each time to download massive programs and constantly troubleshoot was very telling and aptly related to Quinn Debrowski's opinions in "Minimizing Computing Maximized Labor." Specifically in regard to her opinion that genuine change through minimal computing relies mostly on the ability to successfully and smoothly teach it to scholars who need/would like to to use it. If I weren't interested in this process, I doubt I would have been able to make it past my first or second hurdle. I feel that the ability to tech people the skill, could work to genuinely enact change through minimal computing. I hope I can successfully move forward in my process of website building!

# Journal C

Working with OpenRefine this week was pretty interesting. I found that cleaning data felt a bit intangible. I knew that it was important and necessary work, which would of course have a larger impact on the dataset and it's accessibility, yet each refinement that I did seemed hard to track or double check. It seems obvious that the sheer quantity of data that has been opened to single-person-management and accessibility through digitization is far more than previously imagiable. I found that my thoughts on the matter were extremely reminiscent of Kristen Nawrotzki and Jack Dougherty's piece "Writing History in the Digital Age," (the larger text which housed Ansley T. Erickson's "Reflections on 10,000 Digital notecards) where their discussion of The Digital Revolution's transformation of the past held massive impllications not only on the process of the historian, but the larger way in which human beings thinks, process, teach, and communicate as a whole. Addressing massive datasets with media much larger than I could have worked with in an analog sense, immensely complicated my perception of the data at hand. For the most part, we were working with artifacts, each with a complex and rich story, history, and implication, yet I could not name a single artifact or any of their names involved. On the other hand, I could feel the weightage of the potential to accesse and engage with such artifacts, along with opening the possibility to the general public. I am extremely interested in the sense of expansion to our realms of thought and therein our worlds, and working on such a large, and for myself, unintuitive, process of cleaning the data sprouted countless implications. In Erickson's piece, where she entailed her process of keeping thousands of notes on her excursions to various archives, I thought deeply about the capacity of organization of our own thoughts and experiences, essentially externalizing parts of the mind to increase capacity, efficiency, exactitude. There are already innumerable conversations within the digital history realm and the humanities as a whole which discuss the changing of the human mind, the benefits as entailed by Erickson, and the setbacks, relevantly the loss of cognition without exercising out own memories or critical thinking skills. I have long admired Philip Butler's Black Transhuman Liberation Theology where he dives into how 'Techne' assist in the human expansion of the self outside of our physical bodies. Transhuman Liberation Theology is an undoubtedly expansive conversation, yet working with OpenRefine brought up specific connections to his notions of liberation through techne, in this case, liberation of knowledge. The theological aspect was also more than apt, where the sense of overwhelm or perhaps existential dread, was almost reminiscent of religion. There was a sense of power to 'cleaning' such data for masses to possibly access and engage with, we were expanding the realm of knowldge singlehandedly (of course, with the assistance of technology), that literally extended out own capability outside of our bodies. I am more than excited to discuss the topic further in class and explore more media on the topics at hand!
